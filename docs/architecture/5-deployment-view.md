## 5 Deployment-view

For Deployment needed:

-   Webserver
-   Kubernetes-Cluster
-   Helm

To deploy this system, you need to use the Helm Chart in a running Kubernetes cluster. The Helm Chart is located under "charts/registry".
In case you don't have a running cluster, you can set up one by yourself locally, using minikube. For further information checkout the [readme.md](../../README.md) and [install.md](../../INSTALL.md).
